Cyber '23 Side Quest room it says the first of four challenges will be a hidden room that you can get access to via QR code parts hidden in there social pages between Tuesday, 28th November and Thursday, 30th November, hey! today is the 30th, so I can go looking for them ahead of time and be prepared.</p> <p></p> <p>so lets get looking</p> <p>first I try there linked-in, scroll to find what was posted on the dates provided in the clue (between Tuesday, 28th November and Thursday, 30th November)</p> <p></p> <p>huh \ud83e\udd5a\ud83d\udc40 lets see what that link gets us</p> <p></p> <p>ahh, so its a bisected qr-code, I thought it would be multiple QR codes with data in them that you had to read, but this is interesting because if theres only one QR code maybe I can use the parts of it to figure out the rest, but first I should find what else is available</p> <p>well thay gave us a list, so lets follow it in order.</p> <p>There discord is up next, im already there so lets see whats up</p> <p></p> <p>a text channel made just for this room, lets see, pinned mesages</p> <p></p> <p>ooh nice, now there's only one more part relaced, socal media on the list no 3</p> <p>Instagram, oh well time to make a fake account so I can access the posts</p> <p>![note] instagram is being horrid, and while writeing this I wasnt able to get a screenshot never the less:</p> <p>ah ha here it is </p> <p>hmm ok so I have most of the qrcode, but not that top left section,</p> <p>lets see what each part dose and see if we can still get the data</p>"},{"location":"blog/2023/12/11/the-return-of-the-yeti/#repairing-the-qr-code-early","title":"repairing the qr code early","text":"<p>So, what is a qr code made of ?</p> <p>a quick google brought me here: https://www.maketecheasier.com/how-qr-codes-work/</p> <p></p> <p>mmhm mhmm, lots of reading, probably important,</p> <p>looks like im missing one of those positioning markers, the timeing data, format info, and \"content\" cool</p> <p>what is that though?</p> <p></p> <p>ok so, im missing error correction information and maybe some data too, or atleast part of it will be missing</p> <p>lest smooch what I have already together, and add in a marker and some timing pattens</p> <p></p> <p>k then, I cant decode that from my phone, there might be a tool to recover it maybe?</p> <p>google led me to this site https://merri.cx/qrazybox/ a qr code Analysis and Recovery Toolkit, noice</p> <p>what happens when I upload my art project to it?</p> <p></p> <p>detected nice, OOH tools, I like those</p> <p></p> <p>yes yes yes give me the data</p> <p></p> <p>wooo I did it yayyy</p> <p></p> <p>aww 302, redirect, shucks, wrong link. or at least its not entirely garbage, just something isnt right</p> <p>Lets sanity check first, is the room even there?</p> <p></p> <p>dms :</p> <p></p> <p>later in the main chat</p> <p></p> <p>alright then, lets see whats wrong with my qrcode</p> <p>lets look at that tool list and try something else, data sequence analysis, sounds good, I know some of the data is corrupt because it was split in 4 parts and I don't think an open bracket can be part of a URL</p> <p></p> <p>aah yeah, that message data is being read wrong because the missing data was just replaced with white or 0 values</p> <p>well the edit tool lets us paint each bit as either black 1, white 0, or Gray ?</p> <p>lets pain the missing bits and try to get the data again</p> <p></p> <p>yep missing data, lets see what we can use to help us, back in that tools section there was something called Reed-Soloman Decoder, used for \"errors and erasures correction\"</p> <p>now that sounds like a wikipedia rabbithole waiting to happen so ima ignore that and just press buttons and see what happens :3</p> <p></p> <p>well thats good, theres some reed-soloman blocks detected, lets try it</p> <p></p> <p>HA, pure skill, biggest brain ez no luck

this another way, now we have decrypted the 802.1x data, we should see addresses, so lets go to another one of the fue tools in Wireshark I know, the Conversations view</p> <p></p> <p>ok 3 devices, 8.8.8.8 is just googles dns so we can ignore that, whats going on in TCP land? and lets sort by packets so we see whats most chatty</p> <p></p> <p>ok so; lots of small packet examples that only last a tiny amount of time, from the same device, across alot of ports, so thats a packet scanner</p> <p>but the other two very chatty ports are 3389 and 4444 3389 is RDP so we were kind of expecting that,
